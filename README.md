# Waveform #

This is an Android app that detects lines through your phone's camera, and then interprets those lines as sound waves. Those sound waves can be played directly, or they can be mapped to keyboard tones, and played on the onscreen keyboard.

The best way to try out this app is to download it from the play store: [Waveform @ Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.louislepper.waveform&hl=en)

For getting the most interesting sounds I recommend putting your phone on a stand, facing it towards a whiteboard, and drawing soundwaves, like sinewaves, squarewaves, and shapes on the board. You'll need to make sure the board is clean, and doesn't have strong light reflections on it, otherwise patterns other than your hand drawn lines will be detected. (you'll be able to tell if this is happening from the onscreen feedback)

That being said, you can also just point your phone at anything, and hear what it sounds like :-)


For development on this project, you'll need to [setup and get familiar with openCV](http://opencv.org/platforms/android.html). If you have any questions just ask around here or send me a message.

Apologies for the size of the git repo, I included the OpenCV library files.
